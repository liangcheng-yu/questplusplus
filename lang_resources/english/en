in morning i could take an hour bus to from france and i can eventually arrive in germany , then after an hour i could reach to poland .
but this situation was quite different while i was in beijing , if i took the bus in an hour from chaoyang district , and an hour later i was still in chaoyang district .
this is a very popular joke about the traffic situation in beijing .
and in june , 2015 , there are 217 million automobiles in china , among them , 163 of them , the small class .
and in the third season of the year of 2015 , there are most people would spend 30 minutes due to traffic jam , and the cost is about 808 yuan .
so developing the traffic system is quite an important measure to solve the traffic problem .
as we can see from the example in japan , their country has a very developed traffic system , so that their citizens could use their automobiles to spend trips and to those fantastic places.however , due the severe traffic problem they would choose railway station .
.
.
in france , if you go , run , if you take a bus or train in one hour in the morning , you can go through france to german .
but in beijing , in chaoyang district , you , maybe after 2 hours , you are still stucking in the same district .
and this is a , this is a recently very popular , popular jokes online .
in 2015 , in june , there are 271 million automobile , cars , in china . as for automobiles , it stand as for one case , 163 million , and that ’ s a very large number .
in 2015 , the first three quarters that according to statistics , every one hour you spent on the road , you will take thirty minutes to wait . for the traffic congestion , and that weights a month to 808 yuan per person .
so , a very efficient way to remiss such traffic congestion is to develop public transport .
and this has been proved very efficient in japan , tokyo . though there are many small automobiles , but people prefer to choose public transportation when they are going outside . and they would choose automobiles for .
.
.
in the morning , if you travel from france to germany , it will takes you one hour . if you want to take a journey from germany to poland , it will takes you one hour as well .
but in beijing , if you take two hours ’ journey , you will stay , you will still stay at chaoyang district .
this is one of the jokes that internet users make .
until the , until 2015 , june , there are around 2700 , 207 million automobiles in china , including 163 million cars .
until the third quarter of 2015 , people will spend 30 minutes in traffic jam per hour , it will , they will spend on 808 yuan more .
.
the thing in japan is that they develop public transportation , people always choose to take bus or take other .
.
.
in the morning there is always rush hour .
in china , netizens said a joke that one hour you are in , you spend one hour commuting in chaoyang district of beijing and one hour later you are still here .
.
according to the statistics from june 2015 , there are about 271 million private cars in china , in which there are one hundred and sixty-three million private cars .
in the march of 2015 it ’ s , it 's reported that there are 30 minutes of traffic jam if you spend one hour commuting on the road which leads about 808 a cost .
so we have to develop public traffic so that we can ameliorate the situation .
for example in dongjing , in tokyo , there are about 8 million public nets in the city . but they still use private cars . but these private cars are always used for personal recreational and traveling purposes but when they go out , when they go for commuting they will choose public , public transport .
.
.
after an hour you will get to germany , and when you an hour of bus to from germany then you will arrive at poland .
but while at the same time if you take an hour ’ s bus from beijing chaoyang district to another place , after an hour you will find yourselves still at chaoyang district , and still after another one hour you will still find yourself be in chaoyang district .
that is what the netizens joke about the transportation in beijing . beijing is , traffic jam is very serious .
and it already has 2.27 million trans , cars , private cars .
due to the survey of three seasons it is found that when you take 1 hour ’ s journey you will spend 30 minutes on the , on the road because of the traffic jam , if you change the time weight in the money you will find you have waste 808 yuan on the road .
so it is very important for us to develop the public transportation .
as well as in tokyo japan
.
.
in france you will take 1 hour to drive to germany and you will take another hour to get into poland .
but with the same time if you are in beijing chaoyang district , you will take one hour to drive still in chaoyang district and you will still in the same place for another 1 hour .
this is a popular passage on the internet about the traffic jam in beijing .
till june in 2015 there are 27.1 billion motor , automobile cars in china in which 163 million are cars .
the third quarter of the year 2015 every one hour aside will take , will account for 30 minutes on the traffic jam which cost 808 yuan for each month .
to take public transportation is a good effective way to solve this problem .
take tokyo as an example , thanks for its good network , transportation network , those people will usually take subway .
.
.
there is a saying that in the morning if you depart from france , then it take , it takes you an hour to get to germany and also it takes you an hour to get to poland .
but if you are in beijing if you spend one hour you are still in the chaoyang district , and then you take another hour you will still in the chaoyang district .
it is , it is an interesting thing about traffic jam in beijing now .
nowadays there are about , there are about 207 thousand cars in beijing .
and if you spend one hour on the road there will be about 30 minutes that you are stuck in the traffic jams . and it will cost nearly 808 yuan lost .
so there are a lot to do with with city traffic .
for example , we take the traffic in tokyo in japan for example , there are also a lot of traffic and cars in tokyo but more and more people will choose to take subway or other transportations when they go out for work and they will avoid take car for traveling .
.
.
if you are at france then you will traffic one you will at german and then after another hour you will be in poland .
but if you are in beijing , 1 hour you will at chaoyang , and another hour ago you will still be at in chaoyang .
this is a joke about beijing traffic jam .
on 2015 , there , there are , there are 217 vehicles in china , and among them it is about 0.163 small , small vehicles .
in beijing , people will spend 30 minutes on the traffic jam if they want to go to area that is one-hour drive , and every month they will spend 500 , 808 yuan on community .
also , so that we can have some measures to tackle this problem . for example we can use public traffic .
in tokyo , they use public traffic instead of some small vehicles , for those small vehicles , they only use them for tourism .
.
.
in the morning if i live in france it only takes me about 1 hour to get to german , germany , and also , and then one hour to poland .
but if i live in beijing , and i spend an hour on the road but i could only stay in the chaoyang district if i spend another one hour i will also in the same area .
so that joke on the internet about the congestion in beijing .
in 2015 , there , the vehicles have reached 217 million , and among which 163 million are cars .
in 2016 , if you spend an hour on road , and 30 minutes you will spend in traffic jam , so it cost about 808 rmb yuan per month .
so to alleviate the congestion we have to develop more public transportation .
so if there are more private cars , but more citizens can also choose the public transportation like trollies or trains , and private cars are mainly used for leisure activities .
so that a very benign combination of private cars and public transportation .
.
nowadays in the morning , when i was in france i take the train for 1 hour and i will go to germany and after another an hour i will go to poland .
however if you are in beijing and you take the bus for 1 hour you are in zhaoyang region , and after one hour you will still in zhaoyang region .
this is a pastiche in the , in the website to talk about the traffic jam problem in beijing .
in 2015 the traffic in china has become very bad . there has been over 0.231 , 0.281 , 0.271 billion to , cars in china , and motor cars have reached 0.163 billion .
and this will , it is over one hour , every hour people take , every hour people take in the bus , they will waste 30 hours in the traffic jams , this will cost 8 yuan zero point yuan among every month .
in order to solve the problem , there have been some effective measures .
and in japan of some developed countries .
.
.
in the morning , you , it takes one hour for you to travel from france to german , and another hour for you to travel from german to poland .
and in beijing , it takes you one hour for you to travel in chaoyang district , and another hour you still in chaoyang district .
this is a funny web blog in the website that is talk about the traffic congestion in the china ’ s society .
and in 2015 , there are 270 million vehicles in china , and among them there are 163 million car .
and in the third quarter of 2016 , three thirty minutes from out of one hundred was wasted in traffic congestion and this cost about 808 yuan .
and it is now an effective way to develop public transportation to solve this kind of problem .
.
.
.
when you travel about one hour you could go from france to germany , and another one hour , you would go to poland .
however in beijing , when you start from the chaoyang district , and after two hours , you will still in chaoyang district .
so there is a joke among the internet .
by june 2015 , for the car per capita , it has 2.7 for everyone .
and every people spend , who spend , when they spend one hour to go from one place to another , they will spend 30 minutes on the traffic congestion , and for the money , it will reach about 808 yuan per month .
so to deal with this kind of problem , the better way is to develop a complete , public traffic networks .
for example , in japan , they have a complete public traffic system . a lot of people , although they have their own cars , they would choose to use traffics for others , and they choose to use their own cars to go for vacation , or for something else .
it is a really good way to deal with this problem .
.
in the morning you will take 1 hour from france to german , germany and take another hour from germany to poland .
but the same time when you take an hour from the chaoyang district in beijing , an hour after you will still in chaoyang district .
it ’ s a joke in the internet to , to make laughing about the traffic jam nowadays in china .
till 2015 in january , the cars of china is 2.71 billion , the small cars included is the 1.63 billion .
so the traffic jam in the peak hours , it will take , it will take you 30 minutes in an hour to for you to get to the traffic . and in calculation it will cost you 808 yuan per month for you to cost on the traffic jam .
so an effective way to solve this problem is to develop public transportation .
for example , in tokyo , there was about 8 million car transportation , and this , there people there have much more cars than people in beijing china .
but they have a very well-developed transportation system , public transport system . that means that you can take time in your leisure time with small cars for vacation , but in daily time you will use public transportation .
.
in the morning , if you are in the france and take bus and after one hour you will , you will arrive in german , and after another one hour you will arrive in poland .
however , in beijing chaoyang district , if you are in the , if you are in the chaoyang district , and after an-hour bus , you will still in the chaoyang district , and after another hour , the situation never change .
for that is a joke on the net to tell to show that , how serious is the traffic jam in beijing .
according to statistics to 2015 , there are , there are , 271 billion , billion cars in china , and among them , 163 billion cars are private cars .
in 1900 , and in 2013 , every person in beijing spend almost 30 minutes on the traffic jam in every hour , in every hour traffic . and the traffic cost of every person is 808 yuan .
it is an efficient way to solve the traffic jam is to build the city , city traffic .
take tokyo as an example , tokyo has a well , tokyo has a well traffic system , even people possess their private cars , they will prefer to took bus .
.
.
in the morning of france , when i take one hour of public transport , i will arrive in one , at one destination , and i take another one hour i will arrive at another destination .
but in beijing , when you are in chaoyang and you take one hour of car , you are still in chaoyang . then you take another hour , you are still in chaoyang .
it is a joke online to mock the transportation in beijing city .
in june 2015 , there are 27 billion mobile cars in the city , and then there are 61.3 billion mobile cars .
every , every hour of transportation , you spend 30 minutes in traffic jam . so the time cost is very high . it rise as 808 rmb per person per capita .
the transportation , the traffic jam problem should be properly resolved .
take tokyo as an example . tokyo has , tokyo , people in tokyo also has automobiles , but they prefer to use railway transportation .
.
.
in the morning , if you are in france , you take one-hour train , you take one-hour train to the germany , and then , you will take one hours to get to the poland .
but in the same time , in chaoyang in beijing , if you spend one hour in the place , then after one hour , then one hour later , you will still in france .
this is one case occur in beijing ’ s morning .
and by , by the , by june 2015 , the electronic cars in beijing has amounted to 2.7 million , billion and , and in this the cars represent 1.63 billion .
and in the third seasonal , 2015 , according to the , statistic , statistics , if you take one hours on the way to your office , then you will waste thirty minutes on the way , and which has cost 808 yuan per person in month , one month .
and so , so , developing the transportation system is really good for easing and lessing the transportation congestion .
and this we can draw the lesson and learn from the tokyo .
.
.
there is a joke that , it takes an hour for you to get from paris to get to germany , and another one hour for you to get to poland .
but in china , beijing , it takes an hour to drive in chaoyang district , and an hour later , you will still in chaoyang district .
.
according to some official estimates that there are over 163 billion cars reserved in china , in china ’ s , in china .
and in terms of beijing , every thirty minutes in an hour will be wasted in traffic jams . and the financial cost is 808 yuan .
.
then talk about the traffic transportation , in terms of tokyo , japan . people there would prefer to take subways as well as private cars for their purposes , if they are going to go on vacation .
.
.
in the morning , in the france , people usually need to take one hours to another place , and also take one hours to the city of poland .
while at the same time in beijing , people take one hours they are still in chaoyang , and also take one hours they are still in the chaoyang .
so it ’ s the problem of the traffic jam . and it a kind of people talk about on the internet .
in china , in beijng , that the people who own the car is about 271 million yuan , million cars , and about 163 million cars for the person .
and they need to take more than 808 yuan for the traffic jam .
.
to solve this problem , in doing jing , they develop , they developed a kind of way to solve this problem . because more people will choose the railway station instead of be in private cars .
and this way is a good way that can solve this problem .
.
if you take an hour , you can go to france to germany , or you can go to poland .
but if you live in beijing , you are still stuck in the road .
.
and according to a report said that until the june 2014 about the 200 , 2.7 billion cars to vehicles are running in the road in beijing .
currently , average , averagely , if you spend an hour in the road , the half of the time you are stuck in the road and not moving . it cost about 808 yuan per month , the cost .
and there is a efficient way to deal with the problem that is to set a public traffic network .
such is doing great in japan , and mainly applied in their daily life and it works us pretty good .
.
.
in the morning , if you are going , if you are in the france , you can travel to the german in an hour , and another hour to the poland .
but if you are in beijing , chaoyang region , you travel for an hour you are still in the chaoyang region . and another hour past , you are still in here .
the transportation jam has become a serious problem in beijing .
and in 2015 , the automobile have reached about 200 million , and the automobiles never have reached to 0.163 billion .
in the three quarter of the 2015 , if you going out for an hour transport , you will spend 30 minutes on the road for the traffic jam . and that means the expansion cost of your time is 808 yuan .
so develop the public transportation in cities is a efficient way to deal with this kind of problems .
take the tokyo in japan for example , the public transportation network is very efficient . and though many people have their own cars , they will choose to have the public transportation at the first choice , and they mainly use the automobiles for the holiday and the tourists .
and that means a good transportation system to choose .
.
it takes one hour from a country to german , and another one hour to poland .
however in beijing , it will takes you one hour from chaoyang district to other places , however another , after another one hour , you are still in chaoyang district .
it is a joke teasing the traffic in beijing , beijing city on the internet .
in 2015 , there is a lot of cars purchased by individuals .
almost a third quarter of 2015 it will , it will take one hour at least for the commute for daily work . and 30 minutes is wasted on the bad traffic . that is you have to spend 808 rmb monthly on the traffic .
so , to solve this problem , we should develop a very effective a public transportation system , because we don ’ t have enough traffics , public traffics .
many people choose to buy private cars , but if we have light traffics , such vehicle . we can , besides , people buy cars , buy cars to travel for vacation and other activities .
.
.
if i am in france , after an hour i can go to germany , after an hour i could be in poland .
but in the chaoyang district in beijing , after an hour i still in this area and after an hour it ’ s the same .
this is the , this is how people on internet talk about the traffic jam in beijng .
until june in 2015 , there are 200 , 271 billion automobile in beijing , among which there are 163 billion cars .
in beijing , every 30 minutes in an hour you can be trapped in a traffic jam . and this caused average of 8.08 yuan .
.
take dong , tokyo of example , they have advanced traffic system . although there are many private cars , the , they use it for , they use it for travel and leisure time .
.
.
in the morning , when i travel from france to germany , it takes me one hour , and another hour , i will travel from germany to poland .
but at the same time , when i ’ m in chaoyang district , after an hour i will still be in chaoyang district , and another hour later still in chaoyang district .
this is a tale about the traffic jam in beijing .
in 2013 , there are many people have cars and may use cars to go about in the daily life .
and in the third quarter of 2015 , for every hour on the road , there were 30 minutes wasted on the traffic jam , and the time cost is about 808 yuan per month .
therefore the public transport system is a good method for coping with the traffic jam problem .
for example , in tokyo in japan , they have an efficient public transportation system , though many people have private cars , still many people choose public transportation as their daily means for transportation .
.
.
in another hour , you ’ ll be in another country .
however at the same time , when you are in the rush hour of morning in beijing , especially in chaoyang district , you will find in other two hours , you ’ ll still be in the same place .
and actually this is a small joke that runs on the internet talking about traffic jams , and the severe condition of this in beijing .
and actually at the end of the year 2013 , there are more than 0.27 billion automobiles in beijing , and especially in china . and among them , a lot of are private-owned cars .
and actually in rush hours or the morning beijing , you will find out that of one hour you spend on the road , 20 minutes you spend in the traffic jam . and the cost of the time would be 808 per month .
and thus we may see it is very urgent and important for us to develop public transport systems .
nowadays for example , take tokyo as an example , it has a very vivid and convenient network of public buses , even though most of citizens own public cars .
.
.
in the morning if you , if you drive a car in france , after an hour you will go to a place . but an hour later you will come to the otherside of the city .
however , in the chaoyang district of beijing , an hour before you stay at where you were , but an hour later you were still there .
beijing people just spend a lot of time on trafic jam . that 's that 's that 's how people said on internet .
in 2015 in the june there were , there are , there were 0.27 billion of automobiles altogether in beijing . however 0.163 billion of them are automobile cars .
in the third quarter of 2015 , people spends a 30 minutes on traffic jam which would lead to a 808 yuan high cost and this is how we spend , how we lose money on traffic jam .
.
and in japan the public bus map is very efficient . though they do not have many cars but their there 's people can still travel very efficiently . people buy cars for many merit use , for example for vacation or travel but we can still do a lot to improve it .
.
.
.
latest facts that when we take a bus or ride car in beijing chaoyang district , after an hour we are still in chaoyang and if we go home on the bus for an hour , we are still in chaoyang district in beijing .
this has clearly show that the public transportation has some problem in beijing and also in other cities in our country .
and in our country there are there are 270 million cars now .
and in 2015 in the , in the , in the autumn there is a survey show that every hour in our country there is , there is almost 30 minutes that we that we have spent on the road to our destination .
so we have , so , the solution to the traffic jam is , is limited .
.
.
.
in the morning , usually it takes me one hour and to get to one locality , and another one hour to get to another locality in france .
however , it is not true of the case in beijing . for example , it take takes me one hour to get to the north part of the chaoyang district , and another hour later , you will still be trapped in the chaoyang district .
this is a kind of joking point that is coined by the citizens to describe the traffic jam in beijing .
by the end of 2015 , there were are about more than 270 million automobiles including cars .
and in the third quarter of 2016 , actually people will be trapped in the traffic jam about 30 minutes per hour , and it will cost about 808 rmb .
the development of transportation will be the key to solving this problem .
and for example , let ’ s take the dong jing , dong jing , tokyo for example , there is about a map of internet coverage , and it will be very important to be in this kind of network .
.
.
in the morning , you are in france . if you take an hour of bus , or driven one hour , you will be in the east . for another hour , you will be in the west .
but as if you were in beijing , after an hour ’ s drive , you ’ ll be in chaoyang district , after another one , you ’ ll still be in chaoyang district .
this is the joke , which is quite popular online talking about the traffic jams in beijing .
in , to 2015 , the automobile number in china is , is the 0.27 billion , among them majority constitute the cars .
in the third quarter of 2015 , in beijing , for , for each one hour on the street , you will spend thirty minutes waiting for the traffic , which constitute the cost of transportation , to 808 rmb per month .
the urban transportation constitute , has one very important in the public transportation , which explains , post the solution for convenient transportation .
for example , in tokyo , due to , thanks a very advanced and comprehended public transport networks , even though many of the locals have their own private cars , but for most of the plan , they use public transportation . for automobiles , they only use them for traveling .
which makes very good circulation for the public usage .
.
from the france , you travel for one hour , then you will arrive in germany .
and then , an hour later , you will be in poland . but in chaoyang , beijing , you spend one hour , you ’ ll still be in chaoyang .
this is a joke that very popular on internet .
at the end of june , 2015 , there are totally 270 million vehicles in beijing , and 163 cars .
at the crescendo , at crescendo of , at the peak of traffic in beijing , you spend one hour and thirty minutes of it , you are on the traffic jam , which costs 808 yuan per month .
to developing public transportation is a very useful way to ease the traffic jam .
for example , in tokyo , primary choice of people to , of traveling , they will choose subway . and cars for the leisure time and traveling around .
in tokyo , the combination of public transportation and cars are very useful .
.
there is a fast adaption forces , globally . resulting to be increasing competition between businesses .
a product can sell for 30 years , this is a custom situation .
nowadays , a a smartphone which is very popular , will be over-dated overnight .
the circulation of one product is very short now .
in this time in information , information is imbalanced .
in time of industry , the information is not complete , and a manufacturer can not know all the information so they just combine all the function into one product .
take shoes as an example . at that time , the manufacturer did not know what types shoes i needed , so they just produces , all types of , all sizes of shoes .
but whose feet is too small or too large , can not find that shoes .
there are more interaction among people , between people and manufacturers . person , personalization is increased ,
but the product which is personalized , do not have very large amount .
.
the over productivity of international business actually increase the compatition , competition in severed .
they have lots of changed taken place in these industries . some business if you can ’ t have a development , then make you selected wide out by the market .
and take the cellphone as an example , a popular cellphone that owned by the consumers may just turn out-of-date in just a short while .
as the , as the light settlement of the product is shorted ,
the internet has greatly impacted the development of the industry , as the information has actually changed everything .
the producers of the industrial field , may can not fail to satisfy the demand of every consumer in the past . so they can buy all of the features at the situation of the product into one .
take shoes as an example . if you want to buy a shoes , the main of the products that you can counted on of the standard size ,
and you can not , whether your feet is too large or too small , sorry , you may not purchase your ideal ones .
but the internet has actually changed all the situation . it satisfies the demands of consumers , however the demand of the personal products is still at different level ,
.
so it requires the companies and products to improve the demands .
the over productivity of international business actually increase the compatition , competition in severed .
they have lots of changed taken place in these industries . some business if you can ’ t have a development , then make you selected wide out by the market .
and take the cellphone as an example , a popular cellphone that owned by the consumers may just turn out-of-date in just a short while .

.
.
.
now internationally , the overcapacity and the , and the , and other elements have made a competition which is among the industry more fiercely .
and now , that one production used for more than 30 years , that method no longer , is no longer used for now . if you choose , if you can not produce effetly , then there are other companies can do so .
and now for example , one phone , it produce very slowly and it production now has the less competitive in the world .
.
and now the information in the quality has made this competition more fierce than ever before .
and the production now they have to know the need for individuals and consumers at very low cost . and they have to combine different products according their needs and according to individual .
for example , a shoe ,
if you are not fit in the standard size , then there is no feet for you .
.
.
.
now there is a common phenomenon of a global overproduction , which costly suit fierce competence in every industry .
in the past , in the seventy years , every product have to be enervate , that it will be considered as outdate . if you don ’ t run fast , there must be someone run faster than you .
take the handy as an example , just because it was released later , it is concerned as an outdate .
and the lifespan of every production is shorten .
so in the industrial time , the , the demand for those , for those industry is low , because there is a lack of information .
and back in industrial time , there is not that much demands and they will combine their high demands as new products .
for example , take shoes as an example . there is no consider how precise is the size of your feet , and there ’ s a standard every shoes .
and if your feet is too big or too small , then i have to say i ’ m sorry .
however , internet has greatly changed this . there ’ s more talk between people and people , and people and industry .
with personal demands rising , but the personal demands is still in relatively low proportion .
so it is a new request for the industry to product quickly with some small amount of new product .
the overcapacity in industrial sectors has increased the competity , competence between factories .
if you can not run fast , there are a lot of people who can run faster than you .
for example , if a phone , a phone is just launched , is newest model one month ago . people hold high , high expectation of that phone . but then , one month later , there is nobody want this phone .
so the cycle of product has been reduced .
the , the information has been the foundation of the industrial year . in the past , we have nonsymetry information structure .
but now with the internet development , the factor can know everybody ’ s desire with very low cost . so the demand has been increased and customized .
for example , in the past , if you want to buy a shoes , they can not know your exact size . so there is only standard size .
if your feet is too small or big , sorry there is no more , there is no shoes for you . but the internet changed everything .
the internet has reduced the cost to connecting people to people , and people to factor .
the customized demand has been increased , but the amount of customers has been reduced .
.
currently the international enterprises face a problem , nowadays overcapacity , and this problem has made competition among enterprises even more , even more severe .
for example , if a product is sold at thirty yuan , but that is outdated , so this product will not in popularity among consumers any more .
take another example , if a cellphone was quite hot , in the past several months , but maybe it is outdated nowadays .
the cycle of production is shorten as well .
while the internet has stricken the industrial world for the foundation for the industrial age . and the information asymmetry shows itself .
a product with low cost can not suit consumers ’ demands . and consumers need the product , which can meet , which can meet their demands better .
for example , a shoe , a pair of shoes may suit , maybe standard way in the past , but it should be more suitable according to the , according to the unique demands of consumers nowadays .
.
.
.
.
in this world there is common phenomenon of the surplus of production . and the competition between enterprises is becoming more and more fierce .
in the past , a product can be used for 30 years , but right now if you can not keep with the time , you will fall behind .
in the past , mobile phone may be a very popular one , but in a few months , it may be outdated .
and that means the product use of years , becoming smaller and smaller .
and right now , the internet become basis of industrial age .
and , but the manufacturers can not meet the demand of every client . and they need more product knowledge .
for example , in the shoes manufacturing factory and most of the factories will use the standard shoes size .
.
but internet can change that . internet can communicate people with people and communicate people with factors . and they can achieve equal connection and meet the personal demands .
.
for example , the enterprises can produce special service and production for different people .
on the context of global economy , economy surplus , the increase may competitive the global , global goods .
for example , we can not to produce the same goods , same size of , same size of goods for more than 30 years . because if you do not run , there ’ ll be , there will always be someone run faster than you .
.
and which greatly reduce the life expectancy of goods .
and which envails and foundation of such , such area of , such era of , which is expectation of the information .
at the same time , the industrialization has provide a foundation of manufacturing . in the past , people don ’ t understand the consumers ’ needs by local . therefore they had to produce , those standard , those standard goods for large amount .
for example , if you buying a shoes , no one will know the how large is your feet . they will only know the standard code .
.
and the , internet has changed all of this . internet has made all , all of our business have industrial amount interconnected . they have magnified the industrialization .
however the individual needs is very limited .
therefore the industry and business turn to manufacture those small goods in the very diversified ways .
the global industry has ,
the global industry has oversupplied over the past 30 years .
the need , the global need of industry has been declined . and the development has been more fast . a products , a product which is fashion , fashionally in the past , can not be fashion for all the time .
.
.
and during the , during the industrial time , factory , factories is not to meet customers ’ needs .
and for example , a shoe company must , a shoe company , a shoe company must make shoes that meet customers ’ needs .
but if your feet is too big or too small , they can ’ t meet your , meet every customer ’ s need .
in the , in the era of internet , the factories is not meet customers ’ needs .
.
.
the overcapacity of the industry has made the enterprises facing more fierce competition .
for example , the product which is previously sold 30 yuan can not , can no longer be sold at that price .
and a mobile for just released for several months become a , very popular for that , to a product that no one bought , no one buying .
it is the period is greatly shortened .
the internet has greatly shaken the foundation of the industry and made the information becoming uncoordinated .
this is because the manufactures can not understand the individual needs of every customer and locals . therefore they often combined the advantages of different products and then make a new products .
for example , when they making a shoe , shoe , and they will also produce the standard type .
if you , if your feet is too big or too small , you can not buy that shoe .
the , the internet has enabled people become , and enable people between people and people between the manufacture they have greater needs . and then the personal need of the customer .
.
so in this way , the enterprise can produce the diversified products as more factory .
there is a propelled competition among different companies ,
and the old , the old tradition of selling of product at 30 rmb , can ’ t make the , make its way out any longer . and you can not remain competitive in production , then you ’ ll be outpaced by others that can make .
and let me give you an example , a very hot spot , a very hot machine , that is very popular in the past days have been outdated .
and from this you can see the light circle of product has been diminished .
and in the area of internet , it has leveraged the information dispatch in the information area .
and in the past , producers do not know very well the specific requirement of each customer , and therefore will only provide product with multi-functions to satisfy the demand .
for example , because the companies do not know exact number of shoes of every customer and they will offer shoes of standard , with standard numbers .
and if your shoes , if your feet is too large or too small , then you can search for some other companies and buy other products .
things have changed due to development of internet . and connection between people and people and between people and companies have been to further developed the customized product . so companies also need to of the mall demand of customized product .
.
.
nowadays , the , the , the overcapacity has become a severe problem worldwide . the enterprises are facing more severe competition around the world .
in the past days , it is reasonable to sell one product for over 30 years , however is not making any sense now .
for example , several days ago , one company produced a kind of cellphone . it , it one great popularity for very short time . however , it ’ s forgotten very quickly by other people .
.
nowadays , the internet play a very important role in manufacturing .
the information , in the past , was not available to every factories , however , seldom factories can meet needs of every customer . the factories usually sell , sold a kind of product with multi-functions .
for example , if they sell , they sell a shoe , they will have many sizes to choose .
if you have over , too fat or too thin shoes , feet , you can ’ t find a proper shoe for yourself .
however , nowadays the information , the internet has changed our world in a very significant way .
.
.
the global production has , the global excessive capacity , has made the competitions between enterprises more fierce ,
and the old fashion practice of 30 years ’ products among the use in the multi times .
for a one-ground cellphone , it is only launched a few months later scheduled and this product has lost popularity among people .
because the cellphone circle has been shortened .
and the , the ushering in of the internet era has made one important foundation , that is the imbalance of information .
and in the industrial era , the product , people have to consider the demand of the product . so that they could combine the different demands of people so that they could make one product .
for example , a pair of shoes , they can not customize the size for the other one , so there ’ s only the standardized size .
so if your feet is too large or too small , i ’ m sorry so we can not offer this specialized shoes .
and the internet has brought reform in these areas , they has to make the enterprises to consider the low cost demand .
.
.
the problem of overcapacity is causing the competition between companies become fierce than ever .
it is said that nowadays , the policy that selling a product at a price 30 yuan will no longer be available . if you can not produce your products faster while others can .
for example , for cellphones , one type of cellphone was released to the market several months later than the schedule , and it becomes a very popular product to a product that a product no one cares about .
so it is to say that the life expectancy cycle for a product are largely shorted mainly due to the internet era .
the internet era has shaped the fundamental base in the industry which is the information asymmetry .
that is to say , that were companies that used to have a fairly high cost to get to understand the cost , the demand of the people . so they can only group together the demand which most people want and make a product .
for example , for shoes , they have only standardized size because they don ’ t know the specific size of their consumers .
if their feet is too fat or too thin , sorry they can not serve you .
however the internet has changed the situation all-round by making the link between people and people and people and factories poser than ever .
that is to say , the individualized demand is exaggerated by now .
.
the overload of industrial capacity around the world has resulted in increasing competitive among manufacturers .
here is an example . previously , a phone that cost 30 yuan may produce combination of other functions .
when it was put on the shelves , it became very popular , however after several months , it came outdated .
that is to say the life cycle in this area have been quickly pulled down .
however the inception of the internet age has resulted in the information asymmetry .
in the information era , the production of , the products , might become more and more popular . here ’ s another example .
if a manufacturer was to produce a pair of shoes , they won ’ t take consideration besides this shoes , instead , there is only unified standards and size .
if your size is smaller or bigger than this one , sorry , it is a , it is a , it is a very pity that the
.
.
.
the over capacity of productivity all around the world have made the competition among different enterprises were fierce than ever before .
in the past , if a product was sold at 30 yuan , such a practice can not be done at present . if you are not fast enough , there are very fast corporation all around the world .
for example , a mobile phone used to be a product aspired for by millions around the world . however , within several , within very short time , this mobile phones have become outdated product .
the life expectancy of these products have been largely reduced due to the merging of internet .
internet has shaping the very basic of , of industrialization . that is the insymmetry of information .
the basic , nowadays in the industrial world , they find it very hard to satisfy every individual ’ s needs at low cost . so they will combine multiple , multiple functions into one product .
if you buy a shoe at a shoe store , they will only provide a standardized size .
if your feet are too big or too small , then i ’ m sorry , your need will not be met .
internet has changed such a landscape that used be seen in the industrialized countries . internet has also shorten the distance between people and people , and people , and between people and these products at very low cost .
.
.
.
nowadays the production span of the products have been greatly shortened .
for example , if an iphone has come , has come out , sometimes it is effected and is very popular . however , after a very short time it will become out-fashioned and out-dated .
thus the life span of these products has been shortened
and they have to realize that because is that the imbalance of information has changed totally by the , by the enters of our internet age .
and so times in the old days when they factories decide to produce something , they would produce the things to meet the needs of most people .
for example , the shoe factory , they produce the shoes according to the standard sizes .
thus if your , if your foot is too large or too small , then you are not appropriate for these shoes .
and nowadays , the culture of the exchange of information between people and between the people and the factories have become much more convenient . thus the demand for the personalized and individual style has been greatly enlightened .
.
thus we have to produce our products in smaller scale , but more personalized size .
in the context of global over-capacity , the competition between enterprises is threaten .
and before , product can be sold at 30 yuan , but this can no longer work . and the pace of the industry is accelerating .
for example , the cellphones . a very , a very anticipated cellphone it pin into the market several months later than expected , then it turned from a very expected one from a very obsolete one , which significantly reduced its cost .
.
and the ie , the development of , of the internet . it greatly shocked the root of the industry . which features the insymmetrity of the information .
and in the industrial area , a factory can produce a product according to the light of the customers . but it only combines the features of several products together to provide some fixed choices for customers .
for example , the customers have different shoe sizes , but they can only sell shoes at the feet size .
then the customers with too big or too small sizes , can not easily find the shoes .
.
.
.
nowadays we have seen the overproduction in the modern society , which cause the fierce competition between companies .
the actions in the past phase do not , do not problems in today society .
for example , a smartphone , it will become a out-of-date product from a popular one just in a few months .
.
the industrialization is the basic for the internet development .
and nowadays because of the industrialization , companies don ’ t know the specific needs of their customers , so they combine a lot of functions in one product .
for example , shoes , companies don ’ t know the specific needs of their customers , which means the size of their foot , so they set up a standard size for all customers .
.
internet changes the situation people can not cope with each other , the communicate is also , is also , is also helpful between people and companies .
.
.
.
.
and , for example , nowadays , there is a mobile phone . and it really a , it really a bombaster but however , it will over-dated with me .
of a product in nowadays society is really short .
.
this is because that in the before , common people and industry had contact with low cost , the industry has to provide products with multiple characteristics .
for example , when you produce a pair of shoes , you only have standard size .
so if you have other needs , the industry will ignore that .
however , due to the development of internet , more and more people put connect with the companies easily . so that they would have more service and the internet house more and more products could to be once own .
.
and it requires that more and more companies could have produced .
nowadays , there is a capacity in the world . so the competition becomes more and more fierce .
.
there was a very popular product many years ago but now nobody wants it .
now people want more updated things in a short period .
in industrial period , because the information is not so well-spread ,
so people always combined some features together to produce a product .
.
.
but now in internet time , people can communicate each other at a very low cost . so the personalized production is much more preferred .
.
so it requires factories can product , produce more personalized products .
well nowadays , our global world faced with surplussed in industry . and competition between different enterprises is getting severe .
.
and , as for example , newly-launched mobile has been quite popular several days ago . but after a short period , it was updated .
.
and by people . and , what ’ s more , because of the coming of the internet , which has changed place of our industry , so that all the mobile producers as well as other manufacturing companies has other needs can be associated .
.
such as when we purchase our shoes , because the companies don ’ t know whether your feet is too big or small , so they will not provide you with the proper size .
.
so that we can know that with the coming of internet age has shortened the distance between people to people as well as the distance between the manufacturer as well as our customer . so that our individual need has been expanded than ever before with such all companies .
but it ’ s not that big as we needed ,
thus all these companies needs to produce all their products in small quantity to situate the need of customers .
the over capacity around the world has become a problem , that ’ s leading to the fierce competition among enterprises .
a product that can be sold for 30 years , no longer it is . if you can not be fast , others will be faster than you .
for example , a cellphone may be very popular at one time but it soon be outdate .
the life expectancy of a product is short as than before .
that the emergence of internet has wakened foundation of the industry . that is the unbalanced distribution of information .
and in the past , factories can not acquire the information of every consumer at a low cost . that it can only combine all the features of a best-selling product .
for example , companies selling shoes do not know the size of feet of everyone ,
if your feet is bigger or smaller than other ones , you can not find a suitable shoes by yourself .
but the emergence of internet has changed this situation . it enabled the connection between people to people .
.
.
nowadays due to the overcapacity , the competition between different companies is becoming more and more fierce .
if you do not run fast , you will fall behind .
like , take the mobile phone as an example . a mobile phone which is expected to be a hot-seller , but after it enter the markets for several months , it soon became outdated .
so nowadays the life period of a product is greatly shortened .
the internet age shapes the features of previous ages which is the imbalance of information .
in the old days , companies can not know the need of every customer .
take the shoes for example , they only produce standard size of shoes .
so if your feet are too big or small , sorry they can not serve your down there .
but nowadays , companies should be oriented to customize their products ,
but the products we personal , personal needs , will not open the big market .
so the mission that companies nowadays are facing is to quickly produce products which is suited to a small portion of customers .
the overcapacity in the global industry has caused heated competition in industries around the world .
in the past , you can sell one thing for 30 years , but that doesn ’ t work in the current age .
for example , one cellphone brand has , has been launched to the market for several months , and then , after several , after some time they did ’ t change the strategy to sell , to customers ,
and they reduce the life of cellphone .
but in the internet age , one very important foundation in the industry which is insymmetry of information has been very valued by the internet .
for example , in the past , the industry can only produce one kind of foots because they don ’ t know the needs of customers , so they have to combine different needs together to sell the same group of products to people .
take shoes for example , they can only sell standard size of shoes , because they don ’ t know the size of your feet .
and if your feet is too thin or too big , then it is not , you can not buy the proper shoes from this inter shoes .
so , but this has changed in the internet age , because internets connected people with industries and customers .
